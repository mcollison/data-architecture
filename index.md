Data Management, that is _collecting_, _organising_, _cleaning_ and _storing_ data, has been shown to be the most time consuming duty of a Data Scientist and recent years have drawn more focus on the skills and technologies. In 2014 [The New York times claimed](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html) Data Scientists spend 50-80% of their time doing Data Management. In 2016 a [Crowd Flower survey](https://visit.figure-eight.com/rs/416-ZBE-142/images/CrowdFlower_DataScienceReport_2016.pdf), Figure 1, showed 60% of Data Scientists claimed they spend the majority of their time doing Data Management. In 2017 a [BHEF report](http://www.bhef.com/sites/default/files/bhef_2017_investing_in_dsa.pdf), Figure 2, showed that the demand for 'data literate' employees goes beyond the Data Scientist title, including more specialist and less specialist roles. In the following set of tutorials we will explore the principles, technologies and techniques behind Data Management. We will look at how to define low level structure in data and use robust data models so data can be shared and queried effectively. We will cover both the fundamental basics and progress towards some of the more specialist applications of Data Management.

The schedule for this day starts with looking at how to describe data, then we look at the principles for publishing data and finally we look at how robust data models allows us to share data.
