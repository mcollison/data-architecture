# Installation
If you are a student at Newcastle University studying CSC8631 installation should be preconfigured on the cluster machines. The instructions below are included so the tutorials can be replicated on your own machines and in the workplace.

These tutorials are written for python so require the python toolchain, listed below. Throughout the tutorials there are further instructions on installing packages from pip and occasionally you will need to also install package dependencies as independent software on your host machine. Command-line instructions are given for for installing the software dependencies assuming you are using a terminal command-line based on the Linux Ubuntu distribution from version 16 or above.

## Python

Python is a popular interpreted language for data handling. These instructions assume you have installed Python 3 or above (the materials were tested on version 3.5.2).

- To install python see here, [https://www.python.org/downloads/].

## Pip
The pip package manager is used for all dependencies in the tutorials. These instructions assume you have installed version 18 or above (the materials were tested on version 18),
- To install pip  [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/]

> ## Installing pip from linux package manager
>
> Note: this can also be done from the package manager in Linux but will create an independent installation of pip which often causes problems with installing packages in the root filesystem and causes conflicting pip environments further down the line.

## IDE
IDEs and text editors are useful for developing and editing code. Atom was used to generate the materials here so I'd recommend using that so that any error are presented in a standardised/familiar format.

- Atom [https://atom.io/] is my editor of choice and comes with python syntax highlighting but there are many add-ons and alternative options.
